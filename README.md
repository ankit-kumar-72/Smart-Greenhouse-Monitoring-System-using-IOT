Description

This project implements a Smart Greenhouse Monitoring System using IoT devices simulated in Cisco Packet Tracer. It demonstrates the capability of monitoring and controlling environmental parameters of a greenhouse through an IoT network.
Features

    Real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture.
    Automated control of irrigation and ventilation systems based on sensor readings.
    Web-based interface for remote monitoring and control.
    Data logging and analytics for optimizing greenhouse conditions.

Usage

    Log in with the default credentials (if any) and explore the dashboard.

    Monitor and control environmental parameters as needed.

Technologies Used

    Cisco Packet Tracer
    IoT protocols (e.g., MQTT, CoAP)
    Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
    (Add any other relevant technologies)
